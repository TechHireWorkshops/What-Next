# What Next?

You've done an amazing amount of work in the last few months and gained the beginnings of a very useful skill set.  Where do you go from here?


## Relax

A bit. You've gone through a marathon sprint, and keeping yourself healthy and happy is perhaps the most important part of being productive.  Give youself some time to unwind and do some of the things you enjoy you had set aside to keep up with the program. Just don't let it go too long. Set a specific end date to your vacation.

## Keep coding

The most important piece of advice is to keep coding. You've learned so many concepts and syntax at once that need further study and digestion. Skills can decay alarmingly fast if you don't keep at them.

If schedules work for you, set aside times during the day that are dedicated to coding, whether that be building a new project, touching up an old one, or just re-doing old lessons and homeworks.

### Code what?

It will be very difficult to develop your skills in all of your languages, frameworks, and stacks at the same time. I would suggest picking your favorite or the one you feel will be most conducive to your future jobs.  If you see lots of job postings in a certain language, it might make sense to commit your time to sharpening up on that one. Focus on what you're strongest in, what you enjoy doing, or what you think will be most usfull in the future.

#### Should I learn a new language/framework?
That's a difficult question.  It's more important to be really good at a few languages than ok in many. You should only start a new language once you've mastered the ones you use regularly, or if you decide to commit to the switch and make that your new primary. It's usually better to learn new features in a language you know than a whole new language.

### Code how?

#### Old lessons
Old lessons are homeworks are probably the best way to start. Run through the course in the topic you're looking into, and do any assignments that gave you trouble the first time.  Having a solid base is the best way to go forward.

#### Take a course
Taking a course can be a dangerous prospect. It can be easy to substitute real coding for watching course videos. If you're not writing as you're learning, you're not learning. Courses can be helpful though in filling in gaps in your knowledge and learning new functionality in the languages you already know.

#### Old projects
Old projects can be a good way to refresh your understanding of a stack in a fuller context, but can also be a confusing exercise.

Unless you have a clear idea of how your old projects could be improved in interesting ways, and you have a real passion for them, it might be best to start a new one.  It's unlikely that your GA projects will get you a job offer, so it might be best to start a new one.

#### One offs
You don't necessarily need to create an entire project.  If there's a feature that you're excited to learn, it can be helpful to create an app focused on that. You can avoid some of the parts of programming that you dislike, and focus on developing a new skill you can use in a larger context in the future. If it works well, you might even be able to build a new project around it. If not, it's not a huge loss.

#### New projects
New projects are a chance to strengthen a bunch of different coding skills, learn new features, and build your portfolio.  There are 3 types of projects I'd recommend taking on.

##### Clones

Building a clone of an existing (and usually popular) site can be a great experience. You'll have a model to work off of, and you'll need to analyse the structure of how it works before beginning, which is great practice.  Clones can look good on a portfolio as well, if they can perform a lot of what the original site can. It proves you can code features that are in demand.

##### Games

Games can be a surprisingly complex and interesting experience.  You'll encounter problems you would never expect to find, and develop your ability to be fluid in your problem solving.

##### A site you want to use.

Perhaps the best thing you can build is a site that you wish existed. Maybe that's a brand new thing. Maybe it's a version of a site that you do use with more features or customized to the way you wish you could use it. Building a site you want to use stops you from trying to predict what will work well, and it will motivate you to keep working. Also, if it's something you want to use, that means that others will probably want to use it as well.  That could mean that your site will actually have visitors, or that a prospective employee will be able to see the value in it.

#### Get a coding buddy
Coding with a friend or friends can increase your productivity the same way going to the gym with a friend can. You have someone to hold you accountable, especially in terms of making sure that you show up every day. Two sets of eyes on a problem are better than one, and you get to see new ideas and new bugs more often. Even if you prefer to work alone, try to stay in touch with your peers.

#### Open source projects

Working on an open source project can be rewarding and motivating. Having a set problem in front of you can be helpful if you ever feel paralyzed by choosing for yourself what to work on.

## Study for the interview
Practice all of the skills that you need for the interview.

### Soft skills
Skills like communication are as important as your tech skills.  Find a partner to run mock interviews with and have them critique.

### Whiteboarding
Practice algos! Find whichever site you like best (hackerrank is a good pick), and do a certain number of exercises a day.  If you can wrangle someone into listening to you talk while you solve, that's even better. If not, explain what your doing to yourself, a pet, or an inanimate object as you go.

### Concepts and topics
Run through the list of concepts and topic we looked at, and read up. You don't need to become an expert on any topic. Learn until you can competently explain the topic to someone and understand how it might affect your work.

For data structures, sorts, and searches, make sure you can explain how they work, and you should probably be able to code or whiteboard them.

## Stay up on current topics

Software engineering is a constantly and rapidly evolving field. It can be tempting to stick to your expertise, but it pays to be aware of new developments.

### Medium 

Medium is a collection of articles written by coders about features, frameworks and development.  The Medium daily digest is a daily emailed list of articles based on interests you've specified.  It can be a good way to get a small dose of software dev news every day.

### Dev
dev.to is a community of software engineers who write articles and share news.  Their whole website is open source as well, so you can read their code or contribute.

### Hacker News
Reddit for software engineering

### Podcasts

There are a bunch of good software engineering podcasts, such as: 

- Software Engineering Daily
- Software Engineering Radio
- The Changelog
- Junior Developer Toolbox

## Build your resume
### Freelance
Freelance projects come in all difficulty levels and are usually much easier to get than office jobs.  Freelance projects will often force you to acquire new skills (creating new functionalities, integrating third-party apis, etc.) and can serve as real-world projects to show off on your portfolio and resume.

- [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/)
- [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/)


### Hackathons
Hackathons will also force you to push yourself to complete projects you might not have picked otherwise.  They also offer the opportunity to work with more-experienced coders that can share their experience with you.  Finally, hackathons can also give you concrete accomplishments to put on your resume and experience to talk about in interviews.
